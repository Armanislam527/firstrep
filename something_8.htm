    <h1>I'm Sorry ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
    <p>
      My dearest ‚ù§Ô∏è,
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand I made a mistake ‚Äî not just in what I asked, but in how it made you feel. My intention was never to disrespect you or cross any boundary.
      I was being silly and maybe a little too playful, but I swear I was just trying to teach with love, not embarrass or hurt you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know you're upset, and I respect your feelings. But please know ‚Äî I value our bond more than any joke, more than any post, more than anything. Your trust and comfort mean everything to me. üíï
    </p>
    <p>
      So from now on, I will always be careful with my words, and only send what makes you smile. Because your smile is my peace, and your comfort is my home. 
    </p>
    <p class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è Will you forgive me and let us move forward stronger, together?</p>
    <p style="text-align:right; font-weight:bold;">Yours always,<br> Arman</p>
